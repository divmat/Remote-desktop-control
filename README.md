# Remote-desktop-control
Hey Developers!

This project was made to implement the idea of monitoring a student's activity while lab sessions and controlling it remotely from the admin.

The idea is to capture every frame of the client's desktop using sceenshots and send them back to the server's desktop as well as using Java API's to remotely control key presses and pointer movements of the client's desktop.

This project is made using Netbeans 8.0.2, and we've used some additional Java API's to control key presses and pointer movements.

To excute the code:

Run the ClientInitiator.java file in Client's zip file and ServerInitiator.java file in Server's zip file using Netbeans or any other platform, eg. Eclipse
